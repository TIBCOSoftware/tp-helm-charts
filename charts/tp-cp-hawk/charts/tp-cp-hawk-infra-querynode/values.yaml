  # Pod Security Context configuration
  # This configuration ensures that the pod is run with non-root privileges for enhanced security.
  # The user, group, and filesystem group IDs are all set to 1000.
  # The filesystem group change policy is set to "Always", meaning the filesystem group is always set to the fsGroup.
  # The seccomp (secure computing mode) profile is set to RuntimeDefault, which means it uses the default profile provided by the runtime.
  # The sysctls configuration allows the platform hybrid proxy to bind to low ports (below 1024) as a non-root user.
  # This is achieved by setting the 'net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start' sysctl to 0.
