# Pod Security Context configuration
# This configuration ensures that the pod is run with non-root privileges for enhanced security.
# The user, group, and filesystem group IDs are all set to 1000.
# The filesystem group change policy is set to "Always", meaning the filesystem group is always set to the fsGroup.
# The seccomp (secure computing mode) profile is set to RuntimeDefault, which means it uses the default profile provided by the runtime.
