## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

#### **MinIO Deployment selector de-versioned — `helm upgrade` no longer fails with an immutable-selector error** ([PCP-22409])

The MinIO `Deployment`'s `spec.selector.matchLabels` was emitted via the shared `mcp-stack.labels`
helper, which includes the version-bearing `helm.sh/chart: mcp-stack-<version>` label. Because
`spec.selector` is **immutable**, every chart-version bump changed the selector and made
`helm upgrade` fail with `spec.selector: field is immutable` on any existing MinIO install (MinIO is
enabled for the PostgreSQL major-upgrade backup/restore flow — follow-up to [PCP-22375]).

* The **Deployment** selector is now the version-free `app: <release>-mcp-stack-minio` (mirroring
  `deployment-postgres.yaml`), a label the pod template already carries — so it never changes across
  upgrades. `metadata.labels` and the pod-template labels are **unchanged**: they keep the full
  `mcp-stack.labels` plus `app.kubernetes.io/component: minio` and `app: <fullname>-minio`, so the
  plain `-minio` NetworkPolicy and the PCP-22375 `-minio-upgrade` NetworkPolicy podSelectors still match.
* The MinIO **Service** selector is now **version-free** too (`app: <release>-mcp-stack-minio` +
  `app.kubernetes.io/component: minio`), matching every other Service in the chart. A version-bearing
  Service selector would drop the still-running old MinIO pod from the Service endpoints during a
  version-bump rollout (its `helm.sh/chart` label lags a version behind); the version-free selector
  keeps it in the endpoints throughout.
* The MinIO Deployment now sets **`strategy: Recreate`** (mirroring `deployment-postgres.yaml` /
  `deployment-redis.yaml`). MinIO is a single-writer server on a ReadWriteOnce PVC at `replicas: 1`;
  the default RollingUpdate would surge a second pod that cannot attach the RWO volume →
  Multi-Attach deadlock on every future version-bump upgrade once the selector is stable. `Recreate`
  tears down the old pod before starting the new one.
* **One-time manual migration:** when upgrading from a pre-fix release (mcp-stack chart ≤ 1.0.0-RC-25)
  whose live MinIO Deployment still has the old version-bearing selector, delete it once (the PVC and
  its data are preserved) and re-run the upgrade:
  `kubectl delete deployment <release>-mcp-stack-minio --cascade=foreground` — see the rendered
  `NOTES.txt` upgrade caution.

#### **PostgreSQL major upgrade: backup/migration-check pods are no longer network-fenced during the hook phase** ([PCP-22375])

On a `helm upgrade` the postgres major-version upgrade hooks (`-postgres-backup`,
`helm.sh/hook: pre-upgrade`, hook-weight `-5`; and `-postgres-migration-check`, `post-upgrade`)
run in the Helm hook phase — the main-manifest NetworkPolicies (`networkpolicies.yaml`) are
reconciled only in the main phase, i.e. *after* the pre-upgrade backup Job has already tried to
reach PostgreSQL / MinIO. When upgrading from a release whose persistent postgres/minio NP did
not yet carry the upgrade-job ingress rules, the backup pod was fenced off and the upgrade
stalled. Two changes fix this:

* The persistent postgres and minio NP upgrade-job ingress rules are now gated only on
  `networkPolicies.postgres.allowUpgradeJobs` / `networkPolicies.minio.allowUpgradeJobs`
  (no longer coupled to `postgres.upgrade.enabled`), so the allow-rules exist in the steady
  state and are already present the next time an upgrade is attempted.
* A new pre-upgrade hook template (`networkpolicy-postgres-upgrade.yaml`) emits hook-scoped
  `-postgres-upgrade` / `-minio-upgrade` NetworkPolicies (hook-weight `-10`, so they are
  created before the backup Job at `-5`; delete-policy
  `before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded,hook-failed`, so they are cleaned up after the pre-upgrade
  phase whether it SUCCEEDS or FAILS; if an upgrade is interrupted first (e.g. Helm client crash),
  `before-hook-creation` removes any residual hook NP on the next upgrade so it never accumulates),
  which grant the same
  ingress for the duration of the upgrade hooks. Gated on `postgres.upgrade.enabled`,
  `targetVersion == "18"`, `not backupCompleted` AND the respective `allowUpgradeJobs` flag.
* A fail-fast guard in `deployment-postgres.yaml` now refuses to render when
  `postgres.upgrade.enabled=true` and `networkPolicies.enabled=true` but either
  `networkPolicies.postgres.allowUpgradeJobs` or `networkPolicies.minio.allowUpgradeJobs` is
  `false` — otherwise the backup Job would be silently fenced off and the upgrade would stall.
  Set `networkPolicies.enabled=false` to bypass NetworkPolicy enforcement entirely.

#### **lite→full upgrade: DB-migration Job no longer runs before its dependencies exist** ([PCP-20712])

On a lite→full `helm upgrade`, the `-migration` Job (a Helm hook) fired in the `pre-upgrade` phase —
before the main-manifest phase created the resources it references (the postgres secret and the
gateway `-gateway-secret` / `-gateway-config`). In lite mode the mcp-stack sub-chart is not deployed,
so on the first full-mode upgrade none of those resources pre-existed → the Job pod could not build
its container env → `CreateContainerConfigError`, and the migration had to be run by hand. (A fresh
full-mode install was unaffected — it uses the `post-install` hook, which runs after the main phase.)
Now:

* `migration.hookPhase` is a new value; its default is **`post-install,post-upgrade`**, so the
  migration runs after the main phase has created its deps on both install and upgrade. The Job also
  carries `helm.sh/hook-weight: -5`, so it precedes the other post-upgrade hooks it must beat:
  `registration-jobs` (needs the migrated schema) and `postgres-migration-check`.
* The Job's `envFrom` refs are now `optional`, so a `pre-*` `hookPhase` override cannot
  `CreateContainerConfigError` on a not-yet-created ConfigMap/Secret.
* Override `migration.hookPhase: "pre-install,pre-upgrade"` only when Postgres **and** the gateway
  secret/config are externally managed and already present (e.g. an OCP PGO profile).

> **Caveat:** because the `-migration` Job is now a `post-*` hook on both install and upgrade, a
> manual `helm install --wait` **or** `helm upgrade --wait` of a full-mode release deadlocks (Helm
> waits for Deployment-Ready before `post-*` hooks; the gateway is not Ready until the migration
> runs). The production orchestrator uses neither, so the fresh install and the lite→full upgrade are
> unaffected. For a manual full-mode install/upgrade, omit `--wait`.

#### **External-DB production: gateway no longer crash-loops (exit 137) under a slow PostgreSQL** ([PCP-20499])

In external-DB production mode under a slow external PostgreSQL, the gateway ran its alembic
migration inline in the main container; a multi-minute migration outlived the liveness-probe
window → kubelet SIGKILL (exit 137) → CrashLoopBackOff. Now:

* The app container sets `MCPGATEWAY_SKIP_MIGRATIONS` (from `migration.enabled`) so it skips the
  inline `alembic upgrade head` and only fast-checks schema-at-head; the `-migration` Job is the
  sole migrator.
* The `migration.enabled` startupProbe execs `check_schema_at_head` (was `db_isready.py`) so the
  pod refuses Ready until the schema is migrated.

> **Caveat:** the gateway Deployment now depends on the post-install `-migration` Job, so a
> **manual `helm install --wait`** of a *fresh* full-mode release deadlocks (bundled or external
> PG alike — the dependency is on the post-install Job, not the DB kind; Helm
> waits for Deployment-Ready before post-install hooks). The production orchestrator deploy does
> **not** use `--wait` (unaffected). For a manual full-mode install, omit `--wait`.
> _Superseded by [PCP-20712]: the migration default is now `post-install,post-upgrade`, so a manual
> `helm upgrade --wait` deadlocks too — the earlier "upgrades are safe (`pre-upgrade` runs first)"
> note no longer holds._

### Changed

#### **🔐 Production-Hardened Default Values** ([#3550](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/pull/3550))

Aligned `values.yaml` with `config.py` secure defaults and tightened for production deployments.

**Security defaults now match config.py:**
* `ENVIRONMENT`: `development` → `production`
* `PASSWORD_REQUIRE_UPPERCASE/LOWERCASE/SPECIAL`: `false` → `true`
* `REQUIRE_STRONG_SECRETS`: `false` → `true`
* `MCPGATEWAY_GRPC_REFLECTION_ENABLED`: `true` → `false` (exposes service definitions)
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE`: `true` → removed (commented out; default false)
* `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`: `otlp` → `none` (no collector configured by default)
* `APP_DOMAIN` / `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: `http://localhost` → `https://gateway.local`
* `pullPolicy`: `Always` → `IfNotPresent`

**New security flags (all explicit deny):**
* `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_ADMIN: "false"`
* `TRUST_PROXY_AUTH_DANGEROUSLY: "false"`
* `PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_ENABLED: "false"`
* `MCPGATEWAY_STDIO_TRANSPORT_ENABLED: "false"`
* `PLUGINS_CAN_OVERRIDE_RBAC: "false"`
* `FAILED_LOGIN_MIN_RESPONSE_MS: "250"`
* `TOKEN_USAGE_LOGGING_ENABLED: "true"` / `TOKEN_LAST_USED_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES: "5"`
* `SSRF_BLOCKED_NETWORKS` / `SSRF_BLOCKED_HOSTS` (explicit cloud metadata blocklists)

**Features disabled by default:**
* `LLMCHAT_ENABLED`: `true` → `false` (enable only when LLM providers configured)
* Roots: `DEFAULT_ROOTS/ALLOWED_ROOTS: "[]"`, hidden from UI via `MCPGATEWAY_UI_HIDE_SECTIONS`
* gRPC, OTEL, plugins, session pool sub-settings collapsed behind disabled master switches

**Removed unnecessary settings:**
* `DB_DRIVER` (chart uses PostgreSQL), `DB_SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT`, `DB_QUERY_LOG_*` (7 dev settings)
* `MASKED_AUTH_VALUE`, `PLUGINS_CLI_*`, `TEMPLATES_DIR`/`STATIC_DIR`
* `VALIDATION_*_PATTERN` regex patterns (18 patterns — config.py defaults are secure)
* LLM settings (`GATEWAY_MODEL`, `GATEWAY_TEMPERATURE`, `LLM_*`)

**Collapsed disabled feature sub-settings** (commented out with "uncomment when enabling"):
* Plugins (17), SSO providers (~55), SMTP (9), Session Pool (13), Session Affinity (3)
* Performance Monitoring (7), Security Logging (4), External Log Sinks (5)
* Ed25519 (4), Header Passthrough (2), File Logging (6), gRPC (4)

> **Migration:** If you previously relied on `ENVIRONMENT=development` behavior (relaxed CORS, insecure cookies), set `ENVIRONMENT: development` in your override values file. If you used LLM Chat, add `LLMCHAT_ENABLED: "true"` and the `LLM_*` / `GATEWAY_*` settings to your overrides.

### Added

* `charts/mcp-stack/values-minikube.yaml` — local development overlay for minikube (relaxed SSRF, dev credentials, single replica, `pullPolicy: Never`)

## [1.0.0-RC-18]

### Fixed

#### **🔐 URL-encode DATABASE_URL / REDIS_URL credentials at runtime (PCP-21191)**

`DATABASE_URL` (and the bundled-Redis + auth `REDIS_URL`) were assembled via literal
Kubernetes `$(VAR)` env substitution, which does **not** URL-encode. A PostgreSQL or
Redis user/password containing URL-reserved characters (`@ : / # ?`) produced a
malformed DSN — the gateway and the migration Job then failed to connect (host
mis-parsed, port `ValueError`). This widened with the external customer-managed DB
paths (PCP-20620 / PCP-21401), whose credentials are arbitrary.

The credentials are now percent-encoded at container start by a shared shell prelude
(`mcp-stack.databaseUrlEncode` / `mcp-stack.redisUrlEncode`, using the `python3`
already in the image, reading `os.environ` so shell metacharacters are safe). User and
password are encoded and an IPv6 host literal is bracketed (the db name is passed
through — SQLAlchemy 2.x decodes the userinfo but not the URL path, so normal PG
identifiers stay correct). Applied to the gateway container command, its `startupProbe`, and the migration Job;
`DATABASE_URL` is no longer declared as a raw env var. Chart-only change; no image
rebuild. See `tests/dsn-encode-assert.sh`.

**Upgrade / behavior notes:**
* An operator-supplied `DATABASE_URL` (via `mcpContextForge.config`/`envFrom`) is now
  **authoritative** in full mode (the `[ -z "$DATABASE_URL" ]` guard preserves it). The
  stock `values.yaml` sets no such key; a `--reuse-values` upgrade that carried a stray
  `DATABASE_URL` would now take precedence over the derived Postgres URL.
* On the bundled-Redis + auth path `REDIS_URL` is **re-derived (encoded) at runtime**;
  supply a custom Redis URL via `redis.external.url` / `redis.external.existingSecret`.
* **PgBouncer** (`pgbouncer.enabled=true`, off by default) is **not** covered — the
  edoburu image does not URL-decode the DSN, so reserved-char passwords remain
  unsupported there pending a discrete-`DB_*`-env fix.

## [1.0.0-RC2] - 2026-02-28

### Added

#### **🔐 ServiceAccount Support** ([#1718](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/pull/1718))
* Optional ServiceAccount configuration for cloud IAM integration (AWS IRSA, GCP Workload Identity)
* `serviceAccount.create` - Create a dedicated ServiceAccount for all pods (default: `false`)
* `serviceAccount.name` - Custom ServiceAccount name (uses release fullname if empty)
* `serviceAccount.annotations` - IAM role annotations for cloud provider integration
* `serviceAccount.automountServiceAccountToken` - Control token mounting (default: `true`)
* Applied to all Deployments and Jobs in the chart
* Disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility

#### **🔧 Extra Environment Variables Support** ([#2047](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/issues/2047))
* `extraEnv` - Inject additional environment variables directly into the gateway container
* `extraEnvFrom` - Mount environment variables from existing Secrets or ConfigMaps
* Enables injection of sensitive credentials (SSO secrets, external DB URLs) without modifying templates
* Placed after derived URLs so user values can override `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL` if needed
* Schema validation catches common mistakes (missing `name`, invalid `secretKeyRef` shape)

### Fixed

* **PgBouncer ServiceAccount** ([#1718](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/pull/1718)) - Added missing `serviceAccountName` to pgbouncer deployment for consistency with other components

### Changed

#### **⚡ Metrics Performance Defaults** ([#1799](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/issues/1799))
* **Changed default behavior** - Raw metrics now deleted after hourly rollups exist (1 hour retention)
  - `METRICS_DELETE_RAW_AFTER_ROLLUP`: `false` → `true`
  - `METRICS_DELETE_RAW_AFTER_ROLLUP_DAYS` → `METRICS_DELETE_RAW_AFTER_ROLLUP_HOURS` (units now hours)
  - `METRICS_DELETE_RAW_AFTER_ROLLUP_HOURS`: `168` → `1`
  - `METRICS_ROLLUP_LATE_DATA_HOURS`: `4` → `1`
  - `METRICS_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`: `24` → `1`
  - `METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS`: `30` → `7`
* **Rationale**: Prevents unbounded table growth under sustained load while preserving analytics in hourly rollups
* **Opt-out**: Set `METRICS_DELETE_RAW_AFTER_ROLLUP=false` to preserve previous behavior
* **External observability**: If using ELK, Datadog, or similar platforms, raw metrics are redundant - the new defaults are optimal

#### **🩹 Upgrade Workaround for Legacy BETA-2 Releases**
* **Scope**: Applies to upgrades starting from a release originally installed with chart/app `1.0.0-BETA-2`
* **Symptom**: `helm upgrade` may fail with immutable selector error on MinIO Deployment (`spec.selector ... field is immutable`)
* **Workaround**: Delete only the MinIO Deployment, then rerun upgrade
  - `kubectl delete deployment -n <namespace> <release>-minio`
  - `helm upgrade <release> charts/mcp-stack -n <namespace> ...`
* **Data safety**: This workaround preserves existing PVCs and recreates the MinIO Deployment with current labels

#### **📦 MinIO Default Disabled by Default**
* `minio.enabled` default changed from `true` to `false`
* **Rationale**: MinIO in this chart is used by PostgreSQL major-upgrade backup/restore flow and is not needed on the regular request path
* **Migration**: Set `minio.enabled=true` when using `postgres.upgrade.enabled=true`
* **Upgrade safety**: If your existing release still needs MinIO, pin `minio.enabled=true` in your values before upgrade to avoid MinIO resources being pruned
* **Validation**: Chart now fails template rendering if `postgres.upgrade.enabled=true` while `minio.enabled=false`

#### **🗄️ PostgreSQL Upgrade Safety Hardening**
* Internal PostgreSQL Deployment now always uses `strategy.type=Recreate` to prevent overlapping old/new DB pods on the same PVC
* Added `postgres.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default: `120`) for graceful shutdown window
* Added `postgres.lifecycle.preStop.enabled` (default: `true`) to run a clean `pg_ctl ... stop` before termination
* Added `postgres.persistence.useReadWriteOncePod` (default: `true`) to prefer strict single-pod mount semantics where supported
* **Compatibility**: If your storage class does not support `ReadWriteOncePod`, set `postgres.persistence.useReadWriteOncePod=false` and keep `accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]`

#### **🔒 Ingress TLS and Redirect Hardening**
* Enabled ingress TLS defaults for:
  - `mcpContextForge.ingress.tls.enabled: true`
  - `mcpFastTimeServer.ingress.tls.enabled: true`
* Ingress templates now auto-generate TLS secret names when unset:
  - Gateway: `<release>-ingress-tls`
  - Fast-time: `<release>-fast-time-ingress-tls`
* For nginx ingress classes with TLS enabled, chart now applies secure defaults unless overridden:
  - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"`
  - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"`
  - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/hsts: "true"`
  - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/hsts-max-age: "31536000"`
  - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/hsts-include-subdomains: "true"`
